# Bahrain Air Pollution
## Desceiption
Since air is the most important substance on earth and it affects our health, skin, and mood. This project is done to understand the roots of pollution to secure a healthier future for Bahrain
- Main Goals
   - Discover the pollution distribution across Bahrain cities
   - Find out root causes of polluted air of Bahrain
   - Give a realistic and resonalbe recommendations for Bahrain government to enhance air quality

## Datasets
- Sources:
   - Bahrain Air Quality by Month & Station:
   - [https://www.data.gov.bh/explore]
   - World Wide Air Quality Index: [https://www.aqi.in]
- Column/Features:
  - Station: Name or Number of city where the measurment was taken
  - Year: Measurement date
  - Indicator: Annual average of air quality idicators
  - City type: Idustrial city,close to industial city, or urban city 
  - PM: Particulate matter ≤10µm
  - AQI: Air Quality Index
  -  SO2 & NO2:  Other measured pollutants
## Analysis
 - Etracting useful data: the World Wide Air Quality Index table was created manually 
    by collecting all information from [https://www.aqi.in]
 - Data cleaning: Handle missing values, standardize units, check for anomalies
 - Exploratory Data Analysis: Plot temporal trends, compare stations, 
 - Visiulization: 
 
## Results
- 97 countries around the world their air quality is Good, 47 are Moderate, 3 are Poor, and only 1 is Unhealty
- Bahrain air quality is Moderate (AQI=86)
- PM and NO2 indictor values are unhealthy in Sitra, Asker, Aali, and Bahrain Fort (~2x the recommended values)
  
## Acknowledgment
